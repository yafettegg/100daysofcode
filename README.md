# 100daysofcode
These files contained within are my 100 python projects in 100 days. 

Day1: May 24, 2023
Project: Band Name Generator
Description: Gives user possible Band Name by combining two inputs, city of birth and pet's name. 
Progress: My first Project! I was able to finish this quickly. It wasn't too hard. 

Day2: May 25, 2023
Project: Tip Calculator
Description: Provides the solution from user's inputs: total bill, number of people, and tip percentage; Instead of using a calculator after a meal with friends or family, just use this program. Let it do the work for you. 
Progress: The math portion was a little difficult to figure out but by use of a calculator and with Angela's guidance, I was able to finally put it all together. 

Day3: May 26, 2023
Project: Treasure Island
Description: A game that allows the user to choose what direction they want the game to go and the program executes based off the decision the user made. 
Progress: My code might look different but at the end of the day it's about if your code runs with no errors. And mine does! I finished the assignment but I feel it's too basic and wanted to add more to it. I might upload a revised edition soon with my little tweaks. Unfortunately, I didn't have time today to finish my revised edition. But on my day off, I will. :)
